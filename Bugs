isEmpty Fails
size Passes
search Passes
addBack Fails
addFront Passes
removeBack Fails
removeFront Fails

Based off these results and some testing, I have made a few conclusions:

addBack fails while addFront passes. Based off a test I made, it appears that
an integer is added because the size increases by one, but just not at the back,
so I think that it adds to the front instead of the back.

removeFront and removeBack do not appear to change size values, so they don't
remove anything at all.

isEmpty fails, so it must not use the size() function since that passes.
I'm not sure why it fails though.
